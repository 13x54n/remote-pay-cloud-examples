# Remote Pay Cloud Starter

A sample web application that uses the Clover Connector to connect to a Clover device and perform some basic operations.

You can clone this repository.

    git clone git@github.com:clover/remote-pay-cloud-tutorial.git
    cd remote-pay-cloud-starter
   
  Next, you will need to modify the Clover Connector configuration in index.js.  Please see the "Configuration Note" comments in the code for guidance.
  
  Once the Clover Connector configuration has been set you can build and run the application locally.
  
    npm run build
    npm start 
    
This will start a local server on port 3000. You can then navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.    
    
## Prerequisites
Please see [the Clover Connector documentation ](https://docs.clover.com/build/getting-started-with-cloverconnector-1-3/?sdk=browser) for more information and a list of prerequisites.
